# ASEWA-Project
Artistic Style Exploration with ANNs - Project within the course 'Implementing ANNs with Tensorflow' at the University of Osnabrueck

## Abstract
In this project, we explore the artistic style transfer performed with CNNs like the VGG19 and the ResNet50 and compare different angles regarding for example performance and aesthetics. We look at the theoretical basics of a style transfer and how its feature extraction works. Later we try to compare the networks' results by using an art-style-classifying ResNet and our subjective opinion. Additionally, we will have a look at how the ratio of the weights, different learning rates layer selection and the input image influences the style transfer.
